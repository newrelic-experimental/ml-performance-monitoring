# ML Performance Monitoring
New Relic's MLOps solution provides a Python library that makes it easy to monitor your ML models.

The key features:
 - Easy to integrate
 - ML framework agnostic
 - Full compatibility with New Relic observability framework
	 - Based on the [newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python) library
 - Monitoring and alerting:
	 - Predictions
	 - Features
	 - Missing values
	 - Custom model and data drift
	 - Custom inference data 
	 - Custom performance metrics

## Getting Started
- [Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mlops/bring-your-own/mlops-byo/) - Overview of the New Relic MLOps docs and related resources.
- [Additional Guides](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python) - Learn about New Relic's Telemetry Software Development Kit.

### Example Notebooks
- [Try out](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/XGBoost_on_Boston_housing_prices_dataset.ipynb) an XGBoost model on [Boston housing prices](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) dataset. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/XGBoost_on_Boston_housing_prices_dataset.ipynb)
- [Try out](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/sklearn.RandomForestClassifier_on_Iris_dataset.ipynb) how to simulate 24 hours of model inference data using New Relic MLOps.

### Quickstart

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/XGBoost_on_Boston_housing_prices_dataset.ipynb) easily try an end-to-end example of model monitoring.


```python

# STEP 1: Initialize the monitoring
ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(...)

# STEP 2: Add your algorithm
y = my_model.predict(X)

# STEP 3: Record your data
ml_monitor.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

## Installation
**With `pip`**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring.git
```
<!---**With `conda`**

```sh
TODO - add conda installation code
```--->

## Usage

#### STEP 1: Set Your Environment Variable 
[Get your License key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) (also referenced as `ingest - license`) and set it as environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`.
[Click here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for more details and instructions.

Are you reporting data to the New Relic EU region? click [here](#eu-account-users) for more instructions.

#### STEP 2: Import package
```python
from ml_performance_monitoring.monitor import MLPerformanceMonitoring
```

#### STEP 3: Create model monitor
```python
metadata = {"environment": "notebook"}
model_version = "1.0"
features_columns, labels_columns = (
    ["feature_1", "feature_2", "feature_3", "feature_4"],
    ["target"],
)

ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(
    insert_key=None,  # set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY or send your insert key here
    model_name="My stunning model",
    metadata=metadata,
    features_columns=features_columns,
    labels_columns=labels_columns,
    label_type="numeric",
    model_version=model_version
)
```

#### STEP 4: Do your thing
```python
y = my_model.predict(X)
```

#### STEP 5: Record
```python
ml_monitor.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

#### STEP 6: Monitor and alert
Done! Check your application in the [New Relic UI](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?filters=%28domain%20%3D%20%27MLOPS%27%20AND%20type%20%3D%20%27MACHINE_LEARNING_MODEL%27%29) to see the real time data.


### EU Account Users
If you are using an EU account, send it as a parameter at the MLPerformanceMonitoring call if your environment variable is not set:
* ``EVENT_CLIENT_HOST`` and ``METRIC_CLIENT_HOST``
  * US region account (default)-
    * ``EVENT_CLIENT_HOST``: insights-collector.newrelic.com
    * ``METRIC_CLIENT_HOST``: metric-api.newrelic.com
  * EU region account-
    * ``EVENT_CLIENT_HOST``: insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net
    * ``METRIC_CLIENT_HOST``: metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1
    
It can also be sent as parameters at the MLPerformanceMonitoring call.
